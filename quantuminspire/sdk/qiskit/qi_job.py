    """
    A Qiskit job that is executed on the Quantum Inspire platform. A QIJob is normally created by calling
    ``execute`` (which triggers a `run` on the QuantumInspireBackend ``qi_backend``).

    .. code::

        qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, range(1, 5))
        qc.measure_all()

        job = execute(qc, qi_backend, shots=1024)
        result = job.result()

    The return value of ``execute`` is an instance of QIJob (Qiskit job) and is the equivalent to the Quantum
    Inspire project. It is a container to handle one or more (asynchronous) Qiskit circuits or experiments.
    A Qiskit circuit is equivalent to a Quantum Inspire job.

    To get the Quantum Inspire project-id from ``job`` do:

    .. code::

        qi_project_id = job.job_id()

    To get the list of Quantum Inspire jobs (in dictionary format) from ``job`` do:

    .. code::

        qi_jobs = job.get_jobs()

    QIJob can also be recreated using a ``job_id``, being a Quantum Inspire project-id:

    .. code::

        qi_backend = QI.get_backend('QX single-node simulator')
        job = qi_backend.retrieve_job(job_id)
